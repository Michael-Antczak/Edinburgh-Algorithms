# Stack

In a stack, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out,
or **LIFO**, policy.

## Exercise
Explain how to implement two stacks in one array A[1..n] in such a way that neither stack overflows unless the total number 
of elements in both stacks togetheris **n**. The PUSH and POP operations should run in O(1) time.
