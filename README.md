# [Edinburgh Algorithms](https://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-Algorithms/)

Join us for the weekly (every two weeks?) workshops where we work on Computer Science problems. It happens more often recently that a company would send out an online Hackerrank test to the prospective employees. We want to help people with that, but if you solve CS problems just for fun, then come along too.

We start gently. We want it to be beginners friendly, highly practical meetup, where we introduce some theory, but we would  also work on practical problems from Hackerrank or elsewhere. The balance to be decided later on.

The weapon of choice is JavaScript, but feel free to use any programming language of your choice, or none at all.
