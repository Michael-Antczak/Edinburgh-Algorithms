# Algorithms

### What is an algorithm?  
  > Intuitively speaking, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure (a “recipe”) for
  > performing a task (of solving a problem). [1]  
  
  >Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as
**output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that **transform** the
input into the output. [10]
  
### Do we REALLY need to learn about algorithms and data structures? (5 min)

  Yes and no. 

### Excercise (15 mins)
You are given an array of numbers: `[32, 16, 13, 9, 1, 99, 34, 64]`. In how many ways we can sort its elements? We are not interested here in using any programming language, just plain English.

### What are characteristics of a good algorithm? (5 min)
  - efficient (speed and space)
  - correct
  - simple  
  
### How do we evaluate algoritms? (10 min)

  The running time of a program depends on a number of factors such as:
  - The input given to the program ([input size example](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Intro-to-computer-science/tree/master/examples/size_of_input))
  - The running time of the algorithm on which the program is based.  
  - The quality of the implementation and the quality of the code generated by
the compiler 
  - The machine used to execute the program

### [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)  
  (sorting cards)

```
for i = 1 to length(A)
    j ← i
    while j > 0 and A[j-1] > A[j]
        swap A[j] and A[j-1]
        j ← j - 1
    end while
end for
```

### [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)  

Selection sort on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/a/selection-sort-pseudocode)

```
SelectionSort(A)
// GOAL: place the elements of A in ascending order
1  n := length[A]
2  for i := 1 to n
3     // GOAL: place the correct number in A[i]
4     j := FindIndexOfSmallest( A, i, n )
5     swap A[i] with A[j]
      // L.I. A[1..i] the i smallest numbers sorted
6  end-for
7  end-procedure


FindIndexOfSmallest( A, i, n )
// GOAL: return j in the range [i,n] such 
//       that A[j]<=A[k] for all k in range [i,n]
1  smallestAt := i ;
2  for j := (i+1) to n
3     if ( A[j] < A[smallestAt] ) smallestAt := j
      // L.I. A[smallestAt] smallest among A[i..j]
4  end-for
5  return smallestAt
6  end-procedure
```
