# Algorithms

### What is an algorithm?  
  > Intuitively speaking, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure (a “recipe”) for
  > performing a task (of solving a problem). [1]  
  
  >Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as
**output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that **transform** the
input into the output. [10]
  
### Do we REALLY need to learn about algorithms and data structures? (5 min)

  Yes and no. 

### Excercise (15 mins)
You are given an array of numbers: `[32, 16, 13, 9, 1, 99, 34, 64]`. In how many ways we can sort its elements? We are not interested here in using any programming language, just plain English.

### Excercise (15 mins)

Arrays - DS on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem)   

### What are characteristics of a good algorithm? (5 min)
  - efficient (speed and space)
  - correct
  - simple  
  
### How do we evaluate algoritms? (10 min)

  The running time of a program depends on a number of factors such as:
  - The input given to the program ([input size example](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Intro-to-computer-science/tree/master/examples/size_of_input))
  - The running time of the algorithm on which the program is based.  
  - The quality of the implementation and the quality of the code generated by
the compiler 
  - The machine used to execute the program
